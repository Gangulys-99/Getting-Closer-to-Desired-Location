# Getting-Closer-to-Desired-Location
My CSE Project in 3rd year(5th Semester) on Getting Closer to Desired Destination using C++
Problem Statement: You want to go to a place, say IIT Madras. You have no idea how IITM is connected to your current location, but you do know that going to the airport will get you closer to your destination. So, you go to the airport. Your current location just changed. You now look for another place to go to which will get you closer to IITM. The airplane seat seems like a good place. So, for any current location, we try to find a place X such that it gets us closer to our destination. We do this till we end up at our destination. Apply a design technique to solve the problem.

Problem Analysis: The problem statement dictates us to reach a particular destination from the current location. Given a source(your starting location) and destination it will search for a location which is closer to your destination but the catch is, that particular location should be reacheable directly(or there is a direct path from your current location to that paticular location). So, we start to find a place that will take us closer to our destination and we move there. Now, our location gets updated, and we repeat the process until we reach our destination.

We are supposed to implement a correct algorithm, that will not only solve the problem, but also, reduce the time complexity.
